        <h2>Le Wagon Student - Having a break from Adulting!</h2>

        <p>" Adulting (v): to carry out one or more of the duties and responsibilities expected of fully developed individuals (paying off that credit card debt, settling beef without blasting social media, etc).
        When I resume Adulting, I do some pretty cool stuff and work in a pretty cool place!"</p>

              <p>Go on an adventure, get a coloring book, watch every Disney princess movie, or even spend your day day-dreaming about how fun and easy being an adult will be, anything to keep you from forgetting about your lack of money and your terrible love life.</p>

              <h3>3. Stay in "College" as long as Possible!</h3>
              <p>College may not be easy but it will always be better than being a full-fledged adult. So what's staying in college for a few extra years going to do? There's always that one kid who stays in school until their mid-40s anyways.</p>
